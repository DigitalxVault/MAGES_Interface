## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Audio infrastructure first (all sound features depend on properly initialized AudioContext)
- Roadmap: Sound effects before music (validates audio system with simpler buffer playback)
- Roadmap: 6 phases total following dependency-driven order

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- iOS device testing: Simulator insufficient for audio behavior; need real iPad/iPhone for validation
